### The Day
Today am learning a little bit of [[Obsidian]], nearly nothing, but while i do my research for videos or something than can help my learning, [[Quartz]] call my attention, and also, i need to create a link to [[Github]] to create backup of this.
I challenged myself to do 4 hours of productivity, but am no as i was, is much time, so today I'm going to quit when there are still 2 hours left, I won't do this every time, but today I won't force myself, that will only guide the failure.
Perhaps that's all for today...
