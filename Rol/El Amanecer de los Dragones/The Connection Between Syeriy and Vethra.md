#### Background of Syeriy

Syeriy is a high elf from the Everfrost Kingdom, belonging to the Jut family, one of the five primary families under the Magiya, the ruling family that acts as the crown of the kingdom. The Magiya tradition dictates that every young member from any of the primary families must embark on a journey to seek powerful items, magical knowledge, and other means to enhance their family's status and power.

At nearly level 2, Syeriy set out on his quest, driven by the ambition to obtain the legendary source of immortality. However, his journey was fraught with hardships. Syeriy experienced numerous struggles, including hunger, betrayal, and the weight of his family's high expectations. These trials hardened him and honed his skills as a monk of the Ways of the Shadows. He began to dabble in the arts of a rogue to survive the harsh realities of his quest.

#### Background of Vethra
Vethra is a verdan, a young and curious race known for their adaptability and spontaneous growth spurts. Vethra’s tribe was nomadic, traveling across different lands and learning the secrets of the natural world. Despite the tribe's focus on natural harmony, Vethra harbored a passionate dream: to become an airwoman and achieve flight with manmade machines.

Vethra spent her free time sketching intricate designs of flying machines, motors, and other prototypes. Her drawings were detailed and imaginative, showcasing her excellent drawing skills and innovative thinking. However, her tribe often dismissed her efforts as useless distractions from their way of life. They constantly told her to stop working on these "useless things" and focus on the tribe's needs.
#### The Meeting
While Syeriy was on his quest at level 4 (Monk level 3, Rogue level 1), he stumbled upon Vethra in a dense forest. Vethra was tracking a group of mercenaries who had stolen a powerful artifact, a mystical amulet, from her tribe. The amulet held great significance to the tribe, and Vethra was determined to retrieve it, believing that doing so would also prove the value of her skills and inventions.
#### The Adventure
where Syeriy, using his ability to detect magic items, quickly discerned that the amulet they sought was not imbued with any magical properties. Despite this revelation, Vethra remained determined to retrieve it, believing its return would prove the worth of her skills and inventions to her tribe.

Despite initial mistrust, they realized their goals aligned and decided to join forces. Vethra used her knowledge of mechanics and her ability to sketch detailed plans to help them devise a strategy to infiltrate the camp where Syeriy quickly discerned that the amulet they sought was not imbued with any magical properties. Despite this revelation, Vethra remained determined to retrieve it, believing its return would prove the worth of her skills and inventions to her tribe.

Notwithstanding the challenges, they managed to retrieve the amulet, only to discover that the amulet was not just a magical item but a key to an ancient verdan sanctuary that held immense power. Recognizing the importance of the amulet to Vethra’s tribe and the potential it had for his own quest for immortality, Syeriy faced a moral dilemma.

  

Through their shared trials, a bond of friendship and mutual respect grew between Syeriy and Vethra. They managed to retrieve the amulet and uncover the secrets of the sanctuary. Instead of taking the amulet for himself, Syeriy decided to help Vethra return it to her tribe, realizing that the journey and the bonds he formed were more important than the artifact itself.

#### Syeriy's Actions
Intrigued by Vethra's determination and captivated by her lifelike self-portrait, Syeriy made a bold decision—he stole the portrait. He saw it not just as a valuable artwork but as a symbol of Vethra's defiance against societal norms and her unwavering pursuit of her dreams. The act spoke to Syeriy's own struggles with familial expectations and his quest for personal power and status.

  

#### Parting Ways

After returning the amulet to Vethra's tribe, Syeriy and Vethra parted with mixed feelings. Vethra, grateful for Syeriy's help, was unaware of the theft but felt a lingering sense of loss. Syeriy, conflicted by his actions yet driven by his ambitions, carried Vethra's stolen portrait with him—a constant reminder of their adventure and the complex emotions it stirred within him.

  

#### Joining the Actual Party

By level 5 (Monk 4, Rogue 1), Syeriy had joined his current party, enriched by his experiences with Vethra. His quest for immortality now encompassed not just personal power but also a deeper understanding of friendship and the pursuit of dreams. The stolen portrait of Vethra remained a poignant reminder of their brief yet impactful connection, challenging Syeriy to confront his own ambitions and the moral implications of his actions.
